# Injecting a Mod into a Data.bin Save
* Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) if you don't already have it
* Download the latest `SaveBinPatcher.zip` from [here](https://github.com/SeekyCt/spm-save-exploit/releases)
* Extract the zip somewhere on your computer
* Move your data.bin file into your extracted SaveBinPatcher
* Move the rel for the mod into your extracted SaveBinPatcher
* Run inject.py in SaveBinPatcher
    * Enter `data.bin` when asked for the path to the input data.bin
    * Enter your game version when prompted
    * Enter the id of the save file you want to replace with the rel loader when prompted
    * Enter the filename of the rel you downloaded when asked for the path to the input rel
    * Enter `output.bin` when asked for the path to the output data.bin
    * Wait a little while for the save to be repacked (usually takes about 20-30 seconds)
* Your save is now patched, return to the tutorial that linked you here for instructions on what to do next
